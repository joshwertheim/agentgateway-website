Use the Guardrail Webhook API to set up your own custom guardrail controls for {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}}.

## About guardrails {#about}

Guardrails provide content safety and PII detection. They are control mechanisms that help ensure safe, consistent, and compliant interactions with large language models (LLMs) by validating both input and output content.

### Benefits of guardrails {#about-benefits}

Because LLMs generate text based on probability calculations and training data that is outside your control and business context, their responses can vary widely. LLMs might hallucinate, generate harmful or unhelpful content, leak sensitive data, or otherwise return unexpected responses that are not aligned with your organization's standards. 

Guardrails mitigate such risks by letting you take action on:

* Input, or the content before sending requests to the LLM.
* Output, or the content before delivering responses to the user.

For example, a guardrail might:

* Scan input and mask sensitive data patterns before they reach the LLM, such as employee IDs or other personally identifiable information (PII).
* Verify that LLM responses follow a required JSON structure before returning them to users.

By applying guardrails to both input and output, you can:

* Reject or mask harmful or unhelpful content.
* Enforce desired formats, content boundaries, and safety rules.
* Comply with regulatory requirements, industry standards, internal policies, style guides, and more.

### Support for guardrails {#about-guardrail-support}

{{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway-capital.md" >}} includes built-in [prompt guards]({{< link-hextra path="/llm/guardrails/">}}) to reject, mask, or pass prompt data through a moderation endpoint.

However, you might want to bring your own guardrails for situations such as:

* Small language models (SMLs) that do not have a moderation endpoint but that you want to use to sanitize input or output.
* Advanced guards and moderation rules that are not part of {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}} or the LLM provider's moderation endpoint.
* Full control over safety and compliance logic.
* Centralized enforcement across multiple models and providers.
* The ability to update your policies without redeploying the gateway proxy or models.
* Extra logging and auditing capabilities that are built into your own guardrail implementation.

To support such advanced scenarios, {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}} includes a Guardrail Webhook API that you can use to bring your own guardrails. This way, your webhook server can integrate with {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}} to process requests synchronously before they reach the LLM and responses before they return to the user. This architecture allows for flexible integration with your existing security and compliance tools.

### Example diagram {#example-diagram}

The following diagram shows a simple sequence of how the Guardrail Webhook API lets your webhook server integrate with {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}} to process LLM requests and responses.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Gateway as Agentgateway
    participant Webhook as Guardrail Webhook
    participant LLM

    Client->>Gateway: Send prompt
    Gateway->>Webhook: Pre-request guardrail check
    Webhook-->>Gateway: Allow/Modify/Reject
    
    alt Request Allowed
        Gateway->>LLM: Forward prompt
        LLM-->>Gateway: Generate response
        Gateway->>Webhook: Post-response guardrail check
        Webhook-->>Gateway: Allow/Modify/Reject
        Gateway-->>Client: Return response
    else Request Rejected
        Webhook-->>Gateway: Return rejection
        Gateway-->>Client: Forward rejection
    end
```

1. The client sends a request to the LLM.
2. {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway-capital.md" >}} receives the request and passes it to the webhook server for a pre-request guardrail check.
3. If the request is allowed, {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}} forwards the request to the LLM. The LLM generates a response that the webhook server can modify before {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}} returns the response to the client.
4. If the request is rejected by the Guardrail Webhook, {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}} forwards the rejection to the client.

### Considerations for using guardrails {#about-considerations}

When implementing a guardrail webhook server, consider the following performance, implementation, and operational factors.

* **Performance impact**: Each guardrail check adds latency to the request-response cycle. Plan accordingly, such as deploying the webhook server close to the gateway proxy to minimize latency and implementing resiliency best practices such as timeouts and horizontal scaling.
* **Implementation challenges**: Your webhook server must handle requests synchronously and respond quickly to avoid user experience degradation. The requests might be streaming or non-streaming.
* **Operational responsibilities**: You are responsible for developing, integrating, and operating your own guardrail webhook server.

### Optimize guardrail webhook performance {#optimize-performance}

To optimize guardrail webhook performance, you can update the {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/gatewayparameters.md" >}} for {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}} with the following settings.

* `GUARDRAIL_WEBHOOK_MAX_CONNECTIONS`: The maximum number of concurrent connections that the gateway can open to the webhook server. A value of `0` means no limit. The default value is `100`. Higher values allow for greater concurrency, which is good for high-throughput systems, such as when many user requests trigger requests to the webhook server. Lower values help reduce resource usage and the risk of overwhelming the webhook server.
* `GUARDRAIL_WEBHOOK_KEEPALIVE_SECONDS`: The number of seconds to keep an idle connection alive. The default value is `300`. Higher values help avoid delays to setup and teardown connections when requests are intermittent. Lower values help free up unused connections faster, which can help if the webhook server does not handle idle connections well.

Example configuration file:



```yaml
kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
apiVersion: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/gatewayparam-apiversion.md" >}}
kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/gatewayparameters.md" >}}
metadata:
  name: agw-override
  namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
spec:
  env:
  - name: GUARDRAIL_WEBHOOK_MAX_CONNECTIONS
    value: "50"
  - name: GUARDRAIL_WEBHOOK_KEEPALIVE_SECONDS
    value: "60"
EOF
```


### More information

* [Example scenario](#example-scenario) of a simple Python webhook server that integrates with the Guardrail Webhook API.
* [Guardrail Webhook API reference docs]({{< link-hextra path="/llm/guardrails/webhook/openapi-spec/">}}).

## Example scenario

To learn how to implement your own guardrail webhook server, you can use the following sample Python webhook server. For the source code, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo-gateway-use-cases/tree/main/ai-guardrail-webhook-server).

The webhook server is configured to take the following actions:

* If the content has the word `block`, the request is rejected with a 403 Forbidden response.
* If the response has the word `mask`, the gateway transforms the word `mask` to asterisks (`****`) in the body with a 200 response.

### Before you begin

{{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agw-prereq-llm.md" >}}

### Step 1: Deploy the webhook server to your cluster

1. Deploy the webhook server. The example includes a Deployment based on the `gcr.io/solo-public/docs/ai-guardrail-webhook:latest` image and Service of type LoadBalancer that listens for incoming requests on port 8000. If the image does not work for your environment, you can build your own from the sample code in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo-gateway-use-cases/tree/main/ai-guardrail-webhook-server).

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: ai-guardrail-webhook
     namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
     labels:
       app: ai-guardrail
   spec:
     replicas: 2
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: ai-guardrail-webhook
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: ai-guardrail-webhook
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: webhook
           image: gcr.io/solo-public/docs/ai-guardrail-webhook:latest
           ports:
           - containerPort: 8000
           resources:
             requests:
               memory: "128Mi"
               cpu: "100m"
             limits:
               memory: "256Mi"
               cpu: "200m"
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: ai-guardrail-webhook
     namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
     labels:
       app: ai-guardrail
   spec:
     selector:
       app: ai-guardrail-webhook
     ports:
     - port: 8000
       targetPort: 8000
     type: LoadBalancer
   EOF
   ```

2. Verify that the webhook server is running.

   ```sh
   kubectl get deploy,svc -n {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} -l app=ai-guardrail
   ```

   Example output:

   ```
   NAME                                   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   deployment.apps/ai-guardrail-webhook   2/2     2            2           88s

   NAME                           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP                                 PORT(S)          AGE
   service/ai-guardrail-webhook   LoadBalancer   172.xx.xxx.xx    <external-ip>.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com   8000:30752/TCP   88s
   ```

3. Save the address of the webhook server in an environment variable. 
   
   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab name="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}

   ```sh
   export WEBHOOK_SERVER_ADDRESS=$(kubectl get svc -n {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} ai-guardrail-webhook -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0]['hostname','ip']}")
   echo $WEBHOOK_SERVER_ADDRESS  
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab name="Port-forward for local testing" %}}
   If the webhook service is deployed in the same cluster as the gateway proxy, you can also use the Kubernetes DNS name of the service, such as `ai-guardrail-webhook.{{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}.svc.cluster.local`.
   ```sh
   export WEBHOOK_SERVER_ADDRESS=ai-guardrail-webhook.{{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}.svc.cluster.local
   echo $WEBHOOK_SERVER_ADDRESS  
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}


### Step 2: Configure the gateway proxy to use the webhook server {#ai-gateway}

Configure an {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} to use the webhook server for prompt guarding.


```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy-apiversion.md" >}}
kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}}
metadata:
  name: openai-prompt-guard
  namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
spec:
  targetRefs:
  - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: HTTPRoute
    name: openai
  backend:
    ai:
      promptGuard:
        request:
        - webhook:
            backendRef: 
              kind: Service
              name: ai-guardrail-webhook
              port: 8000
        response:
        - webhook:
            backendRef: 
              kind: Service
              name: ai-guardrail-webhook
              port: 8000
EOF
```

{{% reuse "agw-docs/snippets/review-table.md" %}} For more prompt guard options such as custom responses, see the {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} API docs for AI.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `targetRefs` | The HTTPRoute that you want to apply the guardrail to. This example uses the `openai` HTTPRoute that you created before you began. |
| `backend.ai.promptGuard` | The AI prompt guarding configuration that you want to set up. In this example, you configure the webhook server for both request and response guardrails. |
| `webhook.backendRef` | The reference to the webhook server service. The example webhook server is configured to use port 8000. |




### Step 3: Test the webhook server {#test-webhook-server}

1. Send a request through {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}} to the OpenAI provider. In the body, include the word `block` to trigger the 403 Forbidden response.

   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab name="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}   
   ```sh
   curl -vi "$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:80/openai" -H content-type:application/json  -d '{
      "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "system",
          "content": "You are a skilled developer who is good at explaining basic programming concepts to beginners."
        },
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "Write a method to block inappropriate content."
        }
      ]
    }'
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab name="Port-forward for local testing" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vi "localhost:8080/openai" -H content-type:application/json  -d '{
      "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "system",
          "content": "You are a skilled developer who is good at explaining basic programming concepts to beginners."
        },
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "Write a method to block inappropriate content."
        }
      ]
    }'
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

   Example response:

   ```
   HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
   ...
   request blocked
   ```

2. Send another request. This time, include the word `mask` in the body to trigger the 200 response with the content masked.

   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab name="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vi "$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:80/openai" -H content-type:application/json  -d '{
      "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "system",
          "content": "You are a skilled developer who is good at explaining basic programming concepts to beginners."
        },
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "Explain masking to me briefly, and show me an example of masking the names of the people in this directory: Alice, Sr. Developer. Bob, Jr. Developer. Charlie, Manager."
        }
      ]
    }'
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab name="Port-forward for local testing" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vi "localhost:8080/openai" -H content-type:application/json  -d '{
      "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "system",
          "content": "You are a skilled developer who is good at explaining basic programming concepts to beginners."
        },
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "Explain masking to me briefly, and show me an example of masking the names of the people in this directory: Alice, Sr. Developer. Bob, Jr. Developer. Charlie, Manager."
        }
      ]
    }'
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

   Example response: Note that the response turns the word `mask` into asterisks (`****`).

   ```
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   ```

   ```sh
   kubectl delete deploy,svc -n {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} -l app=ai-guardrail
   ```

2. Delete the {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}}.

   ```sh
   kubectl delete {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} -n {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} openai-prompt-guard
   ```
