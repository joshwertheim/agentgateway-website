Configure access to multiple OpenAI API endpoints such as for chat completions, embeddings, and models through the same {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/backend.md" >}}.

## About

To set up multiple LLM endpoints, use the `ai.routes` field in the `policies` section of the {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/backend.md" >}} resource. This field maps the API paths to supported route types. The keys are URL suffix matches, like `/v1/models`. The values are the route types, like `Completions` or `Passthrough`.

- `Completions`: Parses the request, translates it to the LLM provider format, and fully processes it as an LLM request. This route type unlocks the full set of {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}} LLM features, such as tokenization and token-based rate limiting, prompt guards, prompt enrichment, model aliasing, transformations, cost tracking, and detailed observability.
- `Detect`: Forwards the request as-is, but makes a best effort to extract the model and token counts so that a subset of policies still applies, specifically token-based rate limiting and telemetry. Guardrails and other request-shaping policies do not apply. Use this route type for endpoints with a format that cannot be automatically parsed by {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}}, but where you still want metrics and rate limiting.
- `Passthrough`: Forwards the request to the LLM provider as-is, with no parsing, processing, or policies. Use passthrough for endpoints that do not need any traffic policy or manipulation, such as health checks or custom endpoints. Otherwise, use the other route types.

Paths are matched in order, and the first match determines how the request is handled. The wildcard character `*` can be used to match anything. If no route is set, the route defaults to the Completions endpoint.

## Before you begin

1. Set up an [agentgateway proxy]({{< link-hextra path="/setup" >}}).
2. Set up [API access to each LLM provider]({{< link-hextra path="/llm/api-keys/" >}}) that you want to use. The example in this guide uses OpenAI.

## Configure multiple endpoints

Configure access to multiple endpoints in your LLM provider, such as for chat completions, embeddings, and models through the same {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/backend.md" >}}. The following steps use OpenAI as an example.

1. Update your {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/backend.md" >}} resource to include a `routes` field that maps API paths to route types.
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: agentgateway.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/backend.md" >}}
   metadata:
     name: openai
     namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     ai:
       provider:
         openai:
           model: gpt-3.5-turbo  # Optional: specify default model
        # host: api.openai.com  # Optional: custom host if needed
        # port: 443  # Optional: custom port
     policies:
       auth:
         secretRef:
           name: openai-secret
       ai:
         routes:
           "/v1/chat/completions": "Completions"
           "/v1/embeddings": "Passthrough"
           "/v1/models": "Passthrough"
           "*": "Passthrough"
   EOF
   ```

   | Setting | Description |
   |---------|-------------|
   | `v1/chat/completions` | Routes to the chat completions endpoint with LLM-specific processing. This endpoint is used for chat-based interactions. For more information, see the [OpenAI API docs for the endpoint](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/chat).|
   | `v1/embeddings` | Routes to the embeddings endpoint with `Passthrough` processing. This endpoint is used to get vector embeddings that machine learning models can use more easily than chat-based interactions. For more information, see the [OpenAI API docs for the endpoint](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/embeddings).|
   | `v1/models` | Routes to the models endpoint with `Passthrough` processing. This endpoint is used to get basic information about the models that are available. For more information, see the [OpenAI API docs for the endpoint](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/models/methods/list).|
   | `*` | Matches any path that doesn't match the specific endpoints otherwise set. Typically, you set this value to `Passthrough` to pass through to the provider API without LLM-specific processing.|

2. Create an HTTPRoute resource that routes traffic to the OpenAI {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/backend.md" >}} along the `/openai` path matcher. Note that because you set up the `routes` map on the {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/backend.md" >}}, you do not need to create any URLRewrite filters to point your route matcher to the correct LLM provider endpoint.

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: openai
     namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     parentRefs:
       - name: agentgateway-proxy
         namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
     rules:
     - matches:
       - path:
           type: PathPrefix
           value: /openai
       backendRefs:
       - name: openai
         namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
         group: agentgateway.dev
         kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/backend.md" >}}
   EOF
   ```
3. Send requests to different OpenAI endpoints. With the routes configured, you can access different OpenAI endpoints by including the full path in your requests:

   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab name="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   **Chat completions:**
   ```sh
   curl "$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS/openai/v1/chat/completions" \
     -H content-type:application/json \
     -d '{
       "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
       "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
     }' | jq
   ```

   **Embeddings:**
   ```sh
   curl "$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS/openai/v1/embeddings" \
     -H content-type:application/json \
     -d '{
       "model": "text-embedding-ada-002",
       "input": "The food was delicious"
     }' | jq
   ```

   **Models list:**
   ```sh
   curl "$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS/openai/v1/models" | jq
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab name="Port-forward for local testing" %}}
   **Chat completions:**
   ```sh
   curl "localhost:8080/openai/v1/chat/completions" \
     -H content-type:application/json \
     -d '{
       "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
       "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
     }' | jq
   ```

   **Embeddings:**
   ```sh
   curl "localhost:8080/openai/v1/embeddings" \
     -H content-type:application/json \
     -d '{
       "model": "text-embedding-ada-002",
       "input": "The food was delicious"
     }' | jq
   ```

   **Models list:**
   ```sh
   curl "localhost:8080/openai/v1/models" | jq
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}
