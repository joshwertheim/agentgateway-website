## About CORS

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature that is implemented by web browsers and that controls how web pages in one domain can request and interact with resources that are hosted on a different domain. By default, web browsers only allow requests to resources that are hosted on the same domain as the web page that served the original request. Access to web pages or resources that are hosted on a different domain is restricted to prevent potential security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site request forgery (CRSF).

When CORS is enabled in a web browser and a request for a different domain comes in, the web browser checks whether this request is allowed or not. To do that, it typically sends a preflight request (HTTP `OPTIONS` method) to the server or service that serves the requested resource. The service returns the methods that are permitted to send the actual cross-origin request, such as GET, POST, etc. If the request to the different domain is allowed, the response includes CORS-specific headers that instruct the web browser how to make the cross-origin request. For example, the CORS headers typically include the origin that is allowed to access the resource, and the credentials or headers that must be included in the cross-origin request.

Review the following diagram to see an example CORS request flow:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant B as Browser (JavaScript)
    participant AGW as Agentgateway Proxy
    participant Backend as Backend Service<br/>(LLM / MCP / Agent)

    Note over B,Backend: CORS Preflight Flow

    B->>AGW: OPTIONS /api (Preflight)<br/>Origin: https://app.example.com
    AGW->>AGW: Check origin against<br/>allowOrigins list

    alt Origin Allowed
        AGW-->>B: 200 OK<br/>access-control-allow-origin: https://app.example.com<br/>access-control-allow-methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS<br/>access-control-allow-headers: Authorization, Content-Type<br/>access-control-max-age: 86400
        B->>AGW: POST /api (Actual Request)<br/>Origin: https://app.example.com<br/>Authorization: Bearer <token>
        AGW->>Backend: Forward request
        Backend-->>AGW: Response
        AGW-->>B: Response + CORS headers
    else Origin NOT Allowed
        AGW-->>B: 200 OK (no CORS headers)<br/>Browser blocks the response
        Note over B: Browser denies access<br/>to response data
    end
```

Note that the preflight request is optional. Web browsers can also be configured to send the cross-origin directly. However, access to the request resource is granted only if CORS headers were returned in the response. If no headers are returned during the preflight request, the web browser denies access to the resource in the other domain.

CORS policies are typically implemented to limit access to server resources for JavaScripts that are embedded in a web page, such as:

* A JavaScript on a web page at `example.com` tries to access a different domain, such as `api.com`.
* A JavaScript on a web page at `example.com` tries to access a different subdomain, such as `api.example.com`.
* A JavaScript on a web page at `example.com` tries to access a different port, such as `example.com:3001`.
* A JavaScript on a web page at `https://example.com` tries to access the resources by using a different protocol, such as `http://example.com`.

### Configuration options {#options}

You can configure the CORS policy at two levels:

* **HTTPRoute**: For the native way in Kubernetes Gateway API, configure a CORS policy in the HTTPRoute. You can choose to apply the CORS policy to all the routes that are defined in the HTTPRoute, or to a selection of `backendRefs`. This route-level policy takes precedence over any {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} CORS that you might configure. For more information, see the [Kubernetes Gateway API docs](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/api-spec/main/spec/#httpcorsfilter) and [CORS design docs](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1767/).
* **{{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}}**: For more flexibility to reuse the CORS policy across HTTPRoutes, specific routes, and Gateways, configure a CORS policy in the {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}}. You can attach an {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} to a Gateway or the routes in an HTTPRoute resource.

## Set up CORS policies

1. Create a CORS policy for the httpbin app in an HTTPRoute or {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}}. The following example sets up custom HTTP methods and max age for requests for the `https://example.com/` and `https://*.ai` origins.

2. Send a request to the httpbin app and use `https://example.com` as the origin. Verify that your request succeeds and that you get back the configured CORS headers.

   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab name="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -I -X OPTIONS http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:80/get -H "host: www.example.com" \

   ```

   {{< /tabs >}}

   Example output: Notice that the `access-control-*` values reflect your CORS policy and change depending on the resources that you created.
   * If you created an HTTPRoute with a CORS filter, you see the `Origin` and `X-HTTPRoute-Header` headers.
   * If you created a TrafficPolicy with a CORS filter, you see the `Origin` and `X-TrafficPolicy-Header` headers.

   Example output:

   ```console {hl_lines=[2,3,4,5]}
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   access-control-allow-origin: https://example.com
   access-control-allow-methods: GET,POST,OPTIONS
   access-control-allow-headers: origin
   access-control-max-age: 86400
   content-length: 0
   ```

3. Send another request to the httpbin app and use `https://example.ai` as the origin. Verify that your request also succeeds and that you get back the configured CORS headers.

   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab name="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh

   Example output: Notice that the `access-control-*` values reflect your CORS policy and change depending on the resources that you created.

   * If you created a TrafficPolicy with a CORS filter, you see the `Origin` and `X-TrafficPolicy-Header` headers.

   Example output:

   ```console {hl_lines=[2,3,4,5]}

   access-control-allow-methods: GET,POST,OPTIONS
   access-control-allow-headers: origin
   access-control-max-age: 86400
   content-length: 0
   ```

4. Send another request to the httpbin app. This time, you use `notallowed.com` as your origin. Although the request succeeds, you do not get back your configured CORS settings such as max age, allowed origin, or allowed methods, because `notallowed.com` is not configured as a supported origin.

   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab name="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh
