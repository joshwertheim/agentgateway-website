Use header and query matchers in a route delegation setup.

## Configuration overview

In this guide, you add headers and query parameters as matchers on a parent HTTPRoute. Parent matchers control which requests are delegated. Child matchers independently control which delegated requests are routed to a backend. A child can define additional matchers beyond what the parent specifies, or rely solely on path matching.

The following image illustrates the route delegation hierarchy:

{{< reuse-image-dark srcDark="img/route-delegation-header-query-dark.svg" width="800" >}}

**`parent` HTTPRoute**:
* Delegates traffic as follows:
  * `/anything/team1` is delegated to `child-team1` in namespace `team1` for requests that include the `header1: val1` request header and the `query1=val1` query parameter.
  * `/anything/team2` is delegated to `child-team2` in namespace `team2` for requests that include the `header2: val2` request header and the `query2=val2` query parameter.

**`child-team1` HTTPRoute**:
* Matches incoming traffic for the `/anything/team1/foo` prefix path when the request includes the `header1: val1` and `headerX: valX` headers and the `query1=val1` and `queryX=valX` query parameters. Matching requests are forwarded to the httpbin app in the `team1` namespace. The child defines additional header and query parameter matchers beyond what the parent specifies.

**`child-team2` HTTPRoute**:
* Matches incoming traffic for the `/anything/team2/bar` exact path and routes that traffic to the httpbin app in the `team2` namespace. Unlike `child-team1`, this child does not define any header or query parameter matchers. It relies solely on path matching, while the parent's matchers control which requests are delegated.

## Setup

1. Create the parent HTTPRoute that matches incoming traffic on the `delegation.example` domain. The HTTPRoute specifies two routes:
   * Route 1 matches on the following conditions. If they are met, the routing decision is delegated to a child HTTPRoute in the `team1` namespace.
     * path prefix match on `/anything/team1`
     * exact header match on `header1=val1`
     * exact query parameter match on `query1=val1`
   * Route 2 matches on the following conditions. If they are met, the routing decision is delegated to a child HTTPRoute in the `team2` namespace.
     * path prefix match on `/anything/team2`
     * exact header match on `header2=val2`
     * exact query parameter match on `query2=val2`
   ```yaml {paths="header-query"}

         queryParams:
         - type: Exact
           name: query1
           value: val1
       backendRefs:
       - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
         kind: HTTPRoute

         namespace: team1
     - matches:
       - path:

         headers:

         queryParams:

       backendRefs:

         kind: HTTPRoute
         name: child-team2
         namespace: team2
   EOF
   ```

2. Create the `child-team1` HTTPRoute in the `team1` namespace that matches traffic on the `/anything/team1/foo` path prefix when the `header1: val1` and `headerX: valX` request headers and the `query1=val1` and `queryX=valX` query parameters are present. Requests that meet these conditions are forwarded to the httpbin app.
   ```yaml {paths="header-query"}
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: child-team1
     namespace: team1
   spec:
     rules:
     - matches:
       - path:
           type: PathPrefix
           value: /anything/team1/foo
         headers:
         - type: Exact
           name: header1
           value: val1
         - type: Exact
           name: headerX
           value: valX
         queryParams:
         - type: Exact
           name: query1
           value: val1
         - type: Exact
           name: queryX
           value: valX
       backendRefs:
       - name: httpbin
         port: 8000
   EOF
   ```

3. Create the `child-team2` HTTPRoute in the `team2` namespace that matches traffic on the `/anything/team2/bar` exact path. Unlike `child-team1`, this child does not define any header or query parameter matchers. The parent's matchers still control which requests are delegated to the `team2` namespace.
   ```yaml {paths="header-query"}
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:

     rules:
     - matches:
       - path:
           type: Exact
           value: /anything/team2/bar
       backendRefs:
       - name: httpbin

   EOF
   ```

       -H "header1: val1" \
       -H "headerX: valX" && break
     sleep 2
   done
   {{< /doc-test >}}

4. Send a request to the `delegation.example` domain along the `/anything/team1/foo` path with the `header1: val1` request header and the `query1=val1` query parameter. Verify that you get a 404 HTTP response. Although you included the header and query parameter that are defined on the parent, the headers and query parameters that the child also matches on (`headerX` and `queryX`) are missing.

   Example output:

   ```

5. Send another request along the `/anything/team1/foo` path. This time, include all of the headers and query parameters that the parent and child define. Verify that you get a 200 HTTP response.
   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab name="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -i "http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:8080/anything/team1/foo?query1=val1&queryX=valX" \

     -H "host: delegation.example" -H "header1: val1" -H "headerX: valX"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

   {{< doc-test paths="header-query" >}}
   YAMLTest -f - <<'EOF'
   - name: /team1/foo with full superset of headers/query returns 200
     http:

       method: GET
       headers:
         host: delegation.example
         header1: val1
         headerX: valX
     source:
       type: local
     expect:
       statusCode: 200
   EOF
   {{< /doc-test >}}

   Example output:
   ```

   access-control-allow-credentials: true
   access-control-allow-origin: *
   content-type: application/json; encoding=utf-8
   server: agentgateway
   ```

6. Send a request along the `/anything/team2/bar` path with the parent's matchers (`header2` and `query2`). Verify that you get a 200 HTTP response. The parent's rule delegates the request to the `team2` namespace, and `child-team2` matches on path alone with no additional header or query parameter requirements.
   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab name="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -i "http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:8080/anything/team2/bar?query2=val2" \
     -H "host: delegation.example" -H "header2: val2"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab name="Port-forward for local testing" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -i "localhost:8080/anything/team2/bar?query2=val2" \
     -H "host: delegation.example" -H "header2: val2"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

   {{< doc-test paths="header-query" >}}
   YAMLTest -f - <<'EOF'
   - name: /team2/bar with parent matchers returns 200 (child matches on path only)
     http:
       url: "http://${INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS}:80/anything/team2/bar?query2=val2"
       method: GET
       headers:
         host: delegation.example
         header2: val2
     source:
       type: local
     expect:
       statusCode: 200
   EOF
   {{< /doc-test >}}

   Example output:
   ```

   access-control-allow-credentials: true
   access-control-allow-origin: *
   content-type: application/json; encoding=utf-8
   server: agentgateway
   ```

7. Send another request along the `/anything/team2/bar` path, but without the parent's matchers. Verify that you get a 404 HTTP response. Even though `child-team2` matches on path alone, the parent requires `header2: val2` and `query2=val2` to delegate the request to the `team2` namespace.
   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab name="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -i http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:8080/anything/team2/bar \
     -H "host: delegation.example"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab name="Port-forward for local testing" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -i localhost:8080/anything/team2/bar \
     -H "host: delegation.example"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

   {{< doc-test paths="header-query" >}}
   YAMLTest -f - <<'EOF'
   - name: /team2/bar without parent matchers returns 404 (no delegation)
     http:
       url: "http://${INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS}:80/anything/team2/bar"
       method: GET
       headers:
         host: delegation.example
     source:
       type: local
     expect:
       statusCode: 404
   EOF
   {{< /doc-test >}}

   Example output:
   ```
