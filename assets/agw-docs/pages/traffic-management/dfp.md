Dynamically resolve upstream hosts at request time.

## About Dynamic Forward Proxy

Dynamic Forward Proxy (DFP) is a filter in Envoy that allows a gateway proxy to act as a generic HTTP(S) forward proxy without the need to preconfigure all possible upstream hosts. Instead, the DFP dynamically resolves the upstream host at request time by using DNS. 

DFPs are especially useful in highly dynamic environments where services come up and down frequently. Such churn makes it hard for a service registry to list all available endpoints at a given time. With DFP, you do not need to have pre-defined destinations. This approach gives you more flexibility to resolve endpoints as the request comes in. 
	
Another common use case for DFPs is to control and monitor all egress traffic. For example, you can apply policies, such as rate limiting, authentication, authorization, and access logging. You can also easily access metrics for the egress traffic that is routed through the forward proxy. 

DFPs are configured in a Backend resource and an HTTPRoute that routes traffic to the DFP Backend. If a request reaches the gateway proxy, the proxy extracts the host header value from the request and uses DNS to resolve the host to an IP address. Then, the request is forwarded to the resolved IP address.

### Considerations

DFPs offer great flexibility for defining routing patterns for your upstream hosts. However, consider the following downsides when using a DFP:

* You cannot configure failover or client-side load balancing policies for DFP-configured routes because no pre-defined upstream hosts exist that determine the desired upstream service.
* DNS resolution is done at runtime, which can have performance implications. If Envoy detects a new domain name, Envoy pauses the request and synchronously resolves this domain to get the IP address of the endpoint. Then, Envoy caches the IP address locally.

## Set up a Dynamic Forward Proxy

1. Create a Backend for the Dynamic Forward Proxy.
   ```yaml {paths="dfp"}
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: agentgateway.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/backend.md" >}}
   metadata:
     name: dfp-backend
     namespace: httpbin
   spec:
     dynamicForwardProxy: {}
   EOF
   ```

2. Create an HTTPRoute that routes incoming traffic to the DFP Backend.
   ```yaml {paths="dfp"}
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     namespace: httpbin
     name: dfp-httproute
   spec:
     parentRefs:
       - name: agentgateway-proxy
         namespace: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
     rules:
       - backendRefs:
           - name: dfp-backend
             group: agentgateway.dev
             kind: {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/backend.md" >}}
   EOF
   ```

{{< doc-test paths="dfp" >}}
YAMLTest -f - <<'EOF'
- name: wait for dfp-httproute HTTPRoute to be accepted
  wait:
    target:
      kind: HTTPRoute
      metadata:
        namespace: httpbin
        name: dfp-httproute
    jsonPath: "$.status.parents[0].conditions[?(@.type=='Accepted')].status"
    jsonPathExpectation:
      comparator: equals
      value: "True"
    polling:
      timeoutSeconds: 300
      intervalSeconds: 5
EOF
{{< /doc-test >}}

{{< doc-test paths="dfp" >}}
YAMLTest -f - <<'EOF'
- name: dfp - request with host httpbin.httpbin.svc.cluster.local returns 200
  retries: 5
  http:
    url: "http://${INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS}:80"
    method: GET
    headers:
      host: httpbin.httpbin.svc.cluster.local:8000
  source:
    type: local
  expect:
    statusCode: 200
EOF
{{< /doc-test >}}

3. Send a request to a hostname of your choice, such as `httpbin.org`. The Dynamic Forward Proxy resolves the host at request time and forwards the request to it, so the host's welcome page is returned. Because no upstream hosts are pre-defined in the Backend, you can send a request to any reachable host without changing the configuration. For example, for quick testing, you might send a request with the host header set to an in-cluster service, such as `httpbin.httpbin.svc.cluster.local:8000`.
   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab name="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vik http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:80 -H "host: httpbin.org" 
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab name="Port forward for local testing" %}}
   1. Port-forward the gateway proxy on port 8080.
      ```sh
      kubectl port-forward deployment/agentgateway-proxy -n {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} 8080:80
      ```
   2. Send a request to the gateway proxy.
      ```sh
      curl -vik http://localhost:8080 -H "host: httpbin.org"
      ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

  
   Example output: 
   ```console
   * Request completely sent off
   < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   ...
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">

   <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>httpbin.org</title>

        <style>
   ...
   ```
